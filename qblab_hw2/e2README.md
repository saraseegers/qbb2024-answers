Step 2.3 Draw conclusions from plot
Based on the plotted data from step 2.2, you should be able to draw some conclusions. Put answers in the file README.md


1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell? 
The exons have the lowest enrichment meaning that negative SNPs must be selected out and not passed on. SNPs in the exons are likely going to be damaging since they will be coding and have deleterious effects on at the organism level. We can tell this is happening based on the overall lower SNP enrichment. 

2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases?
Most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MFA increases because rare SNPs are more likely to occur in areas that are involved in a functional role, such as exons. As touched on in the previous answer, harmful SNPs are going to be selected against but the few SNPs that do pass on become less enriched over time as they increase in frequency. In summary, selection is why MAF increases as features decrease. 

 3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.

It makes sense that the introns, cCREs, and other are very similar since they are more resistant to negative selection. Since these are non-coding regions they are more flexible to alterations. Again as in the previous anwsers, exons are going to have the most selective pressure as this is where downstream effects will happen more drastically such as alterations in proteins. The regulatory features will not be as impacted since they cover less critical regions of the genome in many aspects.
