#3.1 What do each of these values mean, based on the descriptions of what is being labeled?
The nascent RNA signal is representative of how much RNA is in the nucleus. This can be a marker of transcription. The PCNA channel shows how much DNA replication is happening in the nucleus. The ratio of these values can indicate whether there is more transcription or DNA replication occurring in the nucleus.

#3.2 Look at the knocked-down gene with the highest ratio and the one with the lowest ratio. Look up what their functions are and explain if you think this result makes sense.
APEX1 has the lowest ratio, and SRSF1 has the highest. APEX1 is involved in DNA repair, while SRSF1 is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing and other aspects of the mRNA lifecycle. For SRSF1, more mRNA when it is knocked out could reflect its regulatory role in transcription. The low ratio for APEX1 could indicate that when APEX1 is knocked down, the lack of DNA replication leads to less mRNA being transcribed because that machinery is stalled.
